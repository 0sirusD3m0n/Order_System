# Order_System
A basic Sandwhich/Burger Ordering Sytem using C# and WinForms

# Purpose
This was a final for my CIS262AD class. It is a basic ordering system for either a Submarine Sandwhich or a Burger.

It was made using C# and WinForms.

#Dependancies
Everything was made using the basic WinForms template from Visual Studio 2019. There shouldn't be any external dependancies.
